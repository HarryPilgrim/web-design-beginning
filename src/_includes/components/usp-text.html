                <span class="nf-hover-text">Tired of WordPress themes</span> and page builders that make every site look the same? 
                We offer something <span class="nf-hover-text">completely different</span>—custom-coded solutions that stand out 
                from the template crowd. It's like choosing between a <span class="nf-hover-text">custom-built vehicle</span> 
                versus the same model everyone else drives.

            <p class="nf-usp-paragraph">
                After years of specialization, we've mastered <span class="nf-hover-text">every possible layout</span> and 
                <span class="nf-hover-text">every possible challenge</span>. What used to take months now takes weeks. 
                No more bugs, no more struggles—just <span class="nf-hover-text">streamlined efficiency</span> that 
                delivers professional results faster than any page builder ever could.
            </p>
            
            <p class="nf-usp-paragraph">
                Focus on your business while we handle everything. <span class="nf-hover-text">No CMS frustrations</span>, 
                no plugin headaches, <span class="nf-hover-text">no being abandoned to the mistakes</span>. 
                Just clean, secure code that works for you completely—no bandwidth caps, no feature limitations, 
                no surprise price increases eating into your bottom line.

                <span class="nf-hover-text">better security</span>, and <span class="nf-hover-text">complete autonomy</span> 
                from platforms that hold your website hostage."
